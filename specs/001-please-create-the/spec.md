**Feature Branch**: `001-please-create-the`
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "please create the app from docs/thoughts/mcp-character-service-idea.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: Create MCP Character Service
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: AI agents, character management, MCP protocol, story generation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Marked ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows for AI agents managing characters
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Character, Relationship, Personality entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on business needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-26
- Q: How should the system validate narrative coherence? ‚Üí A: Semantic analysis of character attributes and relationship compatibility
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate character creation attempts? ‚Üí A: Reject duplicates with error message
- Q: Which bulk operations should the system support? ‚Üí A: Create multiple characters from template list
- Q: What format should be used for character data export/import? ‚Üí A: JSON format with full character and relationship data
- Q: How should the system track character personality evolution? ‚Üí A: Delta tracking showing only what traits changed when

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
AI agents working on story generation need to create, manage, and query rich character profiles with complex relationships and personality traits. The service enables agents to maintain consistent character representations across multiple story projects, ensuring narrative coherence and character development continuity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI agent needs a new character, **When** it requests character creation with personality traits and backstory, **Then** the system creates a persistent character profile with unique identifier
2. **Given** multiple characters exist, **When** an AI agent establishes a relationship between characters, **Then** the system creates bidirectional relationship links with relationship type and history
3. **Given** an AI agent queries for characters, **When** it searches by personality traits or relationship types, **Then** the system returns matching characters with complete profile data
4. **Given** a character profile exists, **When** an AI agent updates character attributes or relationships, **Then** the system maintains data consistency and narrative coherence
5. **Given** multiple AI agents access the service, **When** they perform concurrent character operations, **Then** the system handles requests without data corruption or conflicts

### Edge Cases
- When an AI agent tries to create duplicate characters with identical names and traits, the system rejects the creation attempt with a descriptive error message
- How does the system handle circular relationship dependencies (A loves B who loves C who loves A)?
- What occurs when character relationship updates would create narrative inconsistencies?
- How does the system respond when character queries return no matches?
- What happens during high-concurrency scenarios with multiple agents modifying the same character?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide MCP-compliant tools for character creation with personality traits, backstory, and demographic information
- **FR-002**: System MUST support character relationship management with bidirectional consistency and relationship type classification
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable character search and retrieval by name, traits, relationships, and narrative roles
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all character data with unique identifiers and maintain referential integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate character data for completeness and narrative consistency using semantic analysis of character attributes and relationship compatibility before persistence
- **FR-006**: System MUST support character profile updates while preserving relationship consistency
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide character archetype templates for common story roles (hero, villain, mentor, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST track character emotional states and personality evolution using delta tracking to show only what traits changed when
- **FR-009**: System MUST support bulk character creation from template lists for story ensemble management
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose health check endpoints for service monitoring and reliability
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all character operations for audit and debugging purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle concurrent access from multiple AI agents without data corruption
- **FR-013**: System MUST respond to character queries within 200ms p95 latency per constitutional requirement
- **FR-014**: System MUST support character data export and import in JSON format with full character and relationship data for story project migration
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate MCP protocol compliance for all tool interfaces

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Character**: Core entity representing a story character with name, personality traits, backstory, demographic information, emotional state, and narrative role. Contains unique identifier and creation/modification timestamps.
- **Relationship**: Represents connections between characters with relationship type (family, romantic, adversarial, friendship), strength/intensity, history, and bidirectional consistency. Links two character entities with metadata.
- **Personality**: Character psychological profile including traits, motivations, fears, goals, and behavioral patterns. Supports personality evolution tracking over time.
- **Archetype**: Template for common character roles with predefined trait patterns and narrative functions. Used for rapid character creation and story structure guidance.
