# Research: MCP Character Service

**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Phase**: 0 - Technology Research and Architecture Decisions

## Research Areas

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation

**Decision**: Use official MCP Python SDK with FastAPI integration  
**Rationale**: 
- Official SDK ensures protocol compliance and future compatibility
- FastAPI provides async support needed for high-performance character operations
- Strong typing with Pydantic aligns with MCP's JSON schema requirements
- Extensive documentation and community support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom MCP implementation: Rejected due to maintenance overhead and compliance risks
- Flask-based implementation: Rejected due to lack of native async support
- Node.js implementation: Rejected to maintain Python ecosystem consistency

### 2. Database Technology

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM  
**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance ensures character relationship integrity
- Advanced indexing supports fast character search (10,000+ characters)
- JSON columns support flexible personality trait storage
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity for relationships
- Proven performance at scale with proper indexing

**Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB: Rejected due to lack of ACID transactions for relationship consistency
- SQLite: Rejected due to concurrent access limitations
- Neo4j: Considered for relationship modeling but rejected due to operational complexity

### 3. Character Relationship Modeling

**Decision**: Hybrid relational-graph approach in PostgreSQL  
**Rationale**:
- Relationship table with bidirectional consistency checks
- JSON columns for flexible relationship metadata
- Recursive queries for relationship traversal
- Maintains ACID properties while supporting complex relationship queries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure graph database: Rejected due to operational complexity
- Document-based relationships: Rejected due to consistency concerns
- Separate relationship service: Rejected due to transaction boundary issues

### 4. Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layered caching with database optimization  
**Rationale**:
- Redis for frequently accessed character profiles
- Database connection pooling for concurrent access
- Optimized indexes on search fields (name, traits, relationships)
- Async processing for non-critical operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory only: Rejected due to persistence requirements
- Database-only: Rejected due to 200ms latency requirements
- Event sourcing: Rejected due to complexity for initial implementation

### 5. MCP Tool Design Pattern

**Decision**: Domain-driven MCP tools with validation layers  
**Rationale**:
- Each character operation maps to specific MCP tool
- Pydantic schemas ensure data validation at protocol boundary
- Domain services handle business logic separately from protocol concerns
- Clear separation enables testing and maintenance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic CRUD tools: Rejected due to lack of domain specificity
- Direct database access tools: Rejected due to business logic bypass
- Monolithic character tool: Rejected due to complexity and testing challenges

### 6. Concurrent Access Strategy

**Decision**: Database-level concurrency with optimistic locking  
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL handles concurrent transactions efficiently
- Version fields enable optimistic locking for character updates
- Connection pooling manages multiple AI agent connections
- Async FastAPI handles high concurrent request loads

**Alternatives considered**:
- Application-level locking: Rejected due to scalability limitations
- Pessimistic locking: Rejected due to performance impact
- Event-driven updates: Rejected due to complexity for initial version

### 7. Observability Implementation

**Decision**: Structured logging with Prometheus metrics  
**Rationale**:
- JSON structured logs for character operation tracking
- Prometheus metrics for performance monitoring (latency, throughput)
- Health check endpoints for service monitoring
- Correlation IDs for request tracing across AI Movie Platform

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple text logging: Rejected due to parsing complexity
- Custom metrics system: Rejected due to integration overhead
- No observability: Rejected due to constitutional requirements

### 8. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive TDD with MCP contract testing  
**Rationale**:
- MCP protocol contract tests ensure tool compliance
- Domain logic unit tests for character business rules
- Integration tests for database and relationship consistency
- Performance tests for latency requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Rejected due to constitutional TDD requirement
- Unit tests only: Rejected due to integration complexity
- End-to-end only: Rejected due to feedback loop speed

## Architecture Decisions Summary

1. **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11 + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + Redis
2. **Protocol Compliance**: Official MCP Python SDK with custom character tools
3. **Data Architecture**: Relational database with JSON columns for flexibility
4. **Performance**: Multi-layer caching with optimized database queries
5. **Concurrency**: Async FastAPI with database connection pooling
6. **Observability**: Structured logging + Prometheus metrics + health checks
7. **Testing**: TDD with contract, unit, integration, and performance tests

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1**: Core character CRUD operations with MCP tools
2. **Phase 2**: Character relationship management with bidirectional consistency
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced search and archetype template system
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and caching layer
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced observability and monitoring

All research findings support the constitutional requirements for MCP compliance, domain-driven design, TDD, performance targets, and observability standards.
