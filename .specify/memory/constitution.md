# MCP Character Service Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. MCP Protocol Compliance
The Character Service MUST implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification completely and correctly. All character operations MUST be exposed through MCP tools with proper JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging. The service MUST provide character creation, retrieval, modification, and relationship management capabilities through standardized MCP interfaces. Character data schemas MUST be well-defined and validated at the protocol boundary.

**Rationale**: As part of the AI Movie Platform's microservices architecture, strict MCP compliance ensures seamless integration with Claude, other AI agents, and the broader ecosystem of MCP-compatible tools.

### II. Domain-Driven Character Modeling
Character entities MUST represent rich, multi-dimensional personalities with consistent attributes, relationships, backstories, and behavioral patterns. The service MUST support character archetypes, personality traits, emotional states, and narrative roles. Character relationships (family, romantic, adversarial, etc.) MUST be explicitly modeled with bidirectional consistency. All character modifications MUST preserve narrative coherence.

**Rationale**: Characters are the heart of storytelling. Rich domain modeling ensures characters feel authentic, consistent, and suitable for complex narrative generation across the AI Movie Platform.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Every MCP tool MUST have contract tests verifying request/response schemas. Character domain logic MUST have comprehensive unit tests. Integration tests MUST verify character persistence and relationship consistency.

**Rationale**: Character services require high reliability and consistency. TDD ensures robust character operations that maintain narrative integrity across complex story generation workflows.

### IV. Performance & Scalability
Character operations MUST complete within 200ms p95 latency. The service MUST support concurrent character creation and modification. Character search and retrieval MUST scale to 10,000+ characters with sub-100ms response times. Memory usage MUST remain under 512MB for typical workloads. Database queries MUST be optimized with proper indexing.

**Rationale**: Real-time story generation requires fast character access. The service must support multiple concurrent AI agents creating and querying characters without performance degradation.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
All character operations MUST be logged with structured JSON including character IDs, operation types, and performance metrics. The service MUST expose Prometheus metrics for request rates, latencies, and error counts. Character relationship changes MUST be audited for narrative consistency tracking. Health checks MUST verify database connectivity and MCP protocol readiness.

**Rationale**: As part of a complex microservices platform, comprehensive observability enables debugging, performance optimization, and maintaining service reliability across the AI Movie Platform.

## Service Architecture Requirements

The Character Service MUST follow microservices patterns with clear separation of concerns. The service MUST expose a REST API for internal platform communication alongside MCP protocol support. Database operations MUST use connection pooling and prepared statements. The service MUST implement graceful shutdown and health check endpoints. Configuration MUST be externalized through environment variables.

Character data MUST be persisted in a relational database with proper foreign key constraints for relationship integrity. The service MUST support database migrations for schema evolution. Backup and recovery procedures MUST be documented and tested. Character data MUST be encrypted at rest for privacy protection.

## Development Workflow

All code changes MUST go through pull request review with at least one approval. Constitution compliance MUST be verified during code review. Breaking changes to character schemas or MCP interfaces MUST be versioned and documented. Performance regression tests MUST pass before merging. Security scanning MUST be performed on all dependencies.

The service MUST maintain API documentation with OpenAPI specifications. Character schema documentation MUST include examples and validation rules. Deployment procedures MUST be automated and tested in staging environments. Rollback procedures MUST be documented and verified.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation from constitutional principles MUST be explicitly justified with technical rationale and approved by project maintainers.

Amendments to this constitution require documentation of the change rationale, impact analysis on existing code, and a migration plan for bringing non-compliant code into alignment. Version increments follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for backward-incompatible changes, MINOR for new principles or expanded guidance, PATCH for clarifications and refinements.
